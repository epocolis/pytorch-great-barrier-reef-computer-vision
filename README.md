# pytorch-great-barrier-reef-computer-vision
in this competition, you will predict the presence and position of crown-of-thorns starfish in sequences of underwater images taken at various times and locations around the Great Barrier Reef. Predictions take the form of a bounding box together with a confidence score for each identified starfish. An image may contain zero or more starfish.

This competition uses a hidden test set that will be served by an API to ensure you evaluate the images in the same order they were recorded within each video. When your submitted notebook is scored, the actual test data (including a sample submission) will be availabe to your notebook.
